# gh-sweep 🧹

This project is an MIT-licensed fork of [Kyle King's original gh-sweep project](https://github.com/KyleKing/gh-sweep).

> A powerful Terminal User Interface (TUI) for GitHub repository management, built with [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea).

**gh-sweep** helps you manage multiple GitHub repositories interactively from your terminal. It fills gaps in the GitHub ecosystem by providing cross-repo visibility, bulk operations, and intelligent analysis.

## Features

### Storage Cleanup
- **🧹 GitHub Actions Storage Cleanup**: Inspect repo git size, Actions artifacts, Actions caches, workflow run logs, releases/assets, and linked packages
- **Preview-first deletion**: Delete Actions artifacts, caches, and failed/cancelled workflow runs with dry-run previews and typed confirmation
- **Local recovery path**: Cleanup runs from your laptop and does not depend on GitHub Actions being available

### Core Features (Phase 1)
- **🌳 Interactive Branch Management**: Visualize branch relationships, create stacked PRs, batch delete with dependency analysis
- **🛡️ Branch Protection Rules**: Compare and sync protection rules across repositories
- **💬 Unresolved PR Comments**: Search, filter, and review unresolved comments with advanced filters and caching

### Coming Soon
- **⚡ GitHub Actions Analytics**: Performance trends, flaky test detection, error log extraction (Phase 2)
- **⚙️ Cross-Repo Settings**: Visual diff and sync of repository settings (Phase 2)
- **🔗 Webhook Management**: Org-wide overview and debugging (Phase 2)
- **👥 Collaborator Management**: Time-boxed access grants for contractors/trials (Phase 3)
- **🔐 Secrets Audit**: Visibility into secrets usage and compliance (Phase 3)
- **📦 Release Overview**: Multi-repo release dashboard and version comparison (Phase 3)
- **🔌 Integrations**: Linear, mani, ghq, and other local git tools (Phase 4)
- **📊 Analytics**: CI runs, AI reviews, comment stats, contributor metrics (Phase 5)

## Why gh-sweep?

**Fills Real Gaps:**
- ✅ No interactive TUI exists for branch protection management
- ✅ No TUI for unresolved PR comment review with advanced filtering
- ✅ No tool bridges GitHub Actions metadata with AI-friendly error extraction
- ✅ Cross-repo settings comparison is CLI-only elsewhere

**Complements Existing Tools:**
- Use **Renovate** for dependency updates → Use **gh-sweep** to visualize health
- Use **Pulumi/Terraform** for IaC → Use **gh-sweep** to detect drift
- Use **BuildPulse** for ML-based flaky tests → Use **gh-sweep** for simple statistics

See [anti-phases.md](.phases/anti-phases.md) for what we don't do and recommended alternatives.

## Installation

### From Source (Development)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/andreamancuso/gh-sweep.git
cd gh-sweep

# Using mise (recommended)
mise install
mise run build

# Or using go directly
go build -o gh-sweep
```

### Using Go Install
```bash
go install github.com/andreamancuso/gh-sweep@latest
```

### Homebrew
No Homebrew tap is currently published for this fork.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Authenticate with gh CLI
gh auth login

# Optional fallback for automation:
# export GH_TOKEN="..."

# Inspect GitHub Actions storage
gh-sweep storage --repo owner/repo --list

# Preview recommended cleanup without deleting
gh-sweep storage --repo owner/repo --recommended --dry-run

# Execute recommended cleanup after non-interactive confirmation
gh-sweep storage --repo owner/repo --recommended --yes

# Launch interactive branch management
gh-sweep branches

# Review unresolved PR comments
gh-sweep comments --repo owner/repo

# Compare branch protection rules
gh-sweep protection --repos "owner/repo1,owner/repo2"

# Launch full TUI
gh-sweep
```

## Configuration

Create `.gh-sweep.yaml` in your home directory or project root:

```yaml
# Default GitHub organization
default_org: your-org

# Repositories to manage
repositories:
  - owner/repo1
  - owner/repo2

# Cache settings
cache:
  ttl: 1h
  path: ~/.cache/gh-sweep

# Filters
filters:
  # Exclude bot users from comment search
  exclude_users:
    - dependabot
    - renovate

# Linear integration (optional)
linear:
  api_key: lin_api_...
  workspace: your-workspace

# mani integration (optional)
mani:
  config_path: ./mani.yaml
```

## Usage Examples

### Branch Management
```bash
# Interactive branch visualization
gh-sweep branches

# Show branch tree for specific repo
gh-sweep branches --repo owner/repo --tree

# Create stacked PRs from selected branches
gh-sweep branches --stacked-prs
```

### Comment Review
```bash
# Search unresolved comments
gh-sweep comments --repo owner/repo

# Filter by author
gh-sweep comments --author username

# Filter by date range
gh-sweep comments --since 2024-01-01

# Fuzzy search in comment text
gh-sweep comments --search "TODO|FIXME"
```

### Branch Protection
```bash
# Compare protection rules
gh-sweep protection --repos "owner/repo1,owner/repo2"

# Apply template to multiple repos
gh-sweep protection --template templates/default.yaml --apply

# Show drift from baseline
gh-sweep protection --baseline owner/baseline-repo
```

### GitHub Actions Storage Cleanup
```bash
# Interactive storage dashboard
gh-sweep storage --repo owner/repo

# Print inventory and largest artifacts
gh-sweep storage --repo owner/repo --list

# Include release asset and package detail
gh-sweep storage --repo owner/repo --list --inspect-releases --inspect-packages

# Preview recommended cleanup:
# - artifacts older than 3 days
# - caches older than 3 days
# - failed/cancelled workflow runs
# - preserves releases, packages, source branches, tags, and git history
gh-sweep storage --repo owner/repo --recommended --dry-run

# Execute recommended cleanup without an interactive prompt
gh-sweep storage --repo owner/repo --recommended --yes

# Delete artifacts older than 3 days
gh-sweep storage --repo owner/repo --delete-artifacts --older-than 3d

# Delete all Actions artifacts
gh-sweep storage --repo owner/repo --delete-all-artifacts

# Delete Actions caches, optionally constrained by age
gh-sweep storage --repo owner/repo --delete-caches --older-than 7d

# Delete failed/cancelled workflow runs
gh-sweep storage --repo owner/repo --delete-runs --conclusion failure,cancelled
```

Storage categories are intentionally reported separately:

- repo git storage
- GitHub Actions artifacts
- GitHub Actions caches
- workflow run logs
- releases and release assets
- GitHub Packages

GitHub billing/storage dashboards can lag after deletion, so the repository API can show cleanup before billing pages refresh.

### Security Notes

`gh-sweep` uses local authentication. Prefer `gh auth login` or a short-lived environment token (`GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN`) with the minimum required scopes. The app does not persist GitHub tokens in `.gh-sweep.yaml` by default.

Cleanup may require these scopes depending on what you inspect/delete:

- `repo`
- `workflow`
- `read:packages`
- `delete:packages`

Package inspection will report the required refresh command when package scopes are missing:

```bash
gh auth refresh -s read:packages -s delete:packages
```

Deletion operations are irreversible. Artifacts, caches, and workflow runs are previewed before deletion. Successful workflow-run deletion requires typed repository-name confirmation even when `--yes` is supplied. Release and package deletion are not part of recommended cleanup.

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.25+
- [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) (recommended) or go task runner
- GitHub CLI authentication or an environment token with the required scopes
